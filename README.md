# ✨ DeepVoice: Multifaceted Speech AI System ✨

## 📚 Project Overview

Welcome to the **DeepVoice** project! This is a comprehensive Artificial Intelligence system leveraging Deep Learning techniques to process and understand human speech in multiple ways.

Our system is designed to go beyond simple transcription, aiming to extract richer information from audio data.

## 🚀 Key Features

Get ready to explore these powerful capabilities:

🗣️ **Emotion Recognition:** Analyze and identify emotions within speech, such as happiness, sadness, anger, neutral, etc.
♂️♀️ **Gender and Region Classification:** Determine the speaker's gender and classify their regional accent based on speech characteristics.
📝 **Speech Content Recognition:** Transcribe spoken language into text.
🎤 **Voice Synthesis:** Generate new voices based on the characteristics of input voices, allowing for voice cloning or generation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using cutting-edge libraries and models:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Core Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Deep Learning Models:** CNN, RNN, Transformer-based models
* **Speech Processing:** MFCC, Spectrogram, WaveNet

## ⚙️ Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd <repository_folder_name> # Replace with the actual folder name (e.g., DeepVoice-SpeechAI)
    ```

2.  **Set up a virtual environment (Recommended):**
    Using a virtual environment helps manage dependencies and avoids conflicts with other Python projects.

    * **Using `venv` (built-in):**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    * **Using `conda`:**
        ```bash
        conda create -n deepvoice_env python=3.x # Replace 3.x with your Python version (e.g., 3.9)
        conda activate deepvoice_env
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the cloned repository directory and install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Make sure you have a requirements.txt file!
    ```
    *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, you'll need to create one listing all the libraries mentioned in the "Technologies Used" section and any others your notebooks import.)*

4.  **Download Models (if necessary):**
    *(Add a step here if your models are not included in the repository and need to be downloaded separately. Provide instructions and links.)*

## 📈 Data

The models were trained using the following datasets:

* **Emotion and Gender Classification Data:**
    🌐 [Berlin Database of Emotional Speech (EmoDB)](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/piyushagni5/berlin-database-of-emotional-speech-emodb)
* **Region Classification Data:**
    🌐 [Vietnamese Speech Labeled by Region](https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/trnngci/vietnamese-speech-labeled-by-region)

*(If you used other datasets for Content Recognition or Voice Synthesis, list them here. Explain where the data files should be placed in the repository structure for the notebooks to find them.)*

## 💻 Usage / Reproducibility

This project includes Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the system's capabilities.

The primary interface for demonstration appears to be the `web_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb` notebook, which launches a web interface.

To run the web interface:

1.  Ensure you have completed the [⚙️ Installation](#--installation) steps.
2.  Activate your virtual environment.
3.  You can run the notebook directly. The original instruction suggested `ipython web_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb`. You can try this if it works for your setup:
    ```bash
    ipython web_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb
    ```
    Alternatively, and more commonly for notebooks with web interfaces, you might run it via JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then, navigate to `web_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb` in your browser and run the cells. The web interface should then become accessible.

**Reproducing Results & Experimentation:**

The notebook `finetune_1layersLTSM.ipynb` likely contains code related to training or fine-tuning models. To reproduce the results or understand the model training process, you would typically run the notebooks in a specific order, likely starting with data preparation (if not handled by separate scripts), then training/fine-tuning, and finally evaluation/analysis.

Assuming a typical flow, you might need to run:

1.  **`finetune_1layersLTSM.ipynb`**: To train or fine-tune the model(s). *Ensure you have the necessary training data set up as described in the [📊 Data](#--data) section.*
2.  **`web_Emotion_Recognition.ipynb`**: To use the trained model(s) via the web interface.

*(**Important:** Review your notebooks to confirm the correct running order and dependencies between them. Update these instructions accordingly.)*

## 🎉 Results

*(This section is currently a placeholder. Once you have compelling results, figures, or demos, describe them here! Include screenshots of the web interface, plots of model performance, examples of synthesized speech, etc.)*

Showcase the exciting outcomes of your research! 🚀
